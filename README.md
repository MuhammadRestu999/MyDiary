MyDiary is a website inspired by the anime [Kimi no Na wa (Your Name)](https://myanimelist.net/xxx), sharing a 90% similarity. Leveraging IndexDB storage, it provides a unique experience. The original codebase was crafted by [ssshooter](https://github.com/ssshooter/MyDiary/), and I have contributed by fixing bugs and implementing updates.


## Features
- Diary Entry: Capture and store your personal thoughts and experiences.
- Contacts: Manage and save your important contacts.
